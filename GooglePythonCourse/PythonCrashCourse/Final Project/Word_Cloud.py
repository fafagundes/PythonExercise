"""

 - Project goal
Create a dictionary with words and word frequencies that can be passed to the generate_from_frequencies
function of the WordCloud class.

Once you have the dictionary, use this code to generate the word cloud image:

cloud = wordcloud.WordCloud()
cloud.generate_from_frequencies(frequencies)
cloud.to_file("myfile.jpg")

Before processing any text, you need to remove all the punctuation marks.
To do this, you can go through each line of text, character-by-character, using the isalpha() method.
This will check whether or not the character is a letter.

To split a line of text into words, you can use the split() method.

Before storing words in the frequency dictionary, check if theyâ€™re part of the "uninteresting"
set of words (for example: "a", "the", "to", "if"). Make this set a parameter to your function so
that you can change it if necessary.

 - Input file
For the input file, you need to provide a file that contains text only.
For the text itself, you can copy and paste the contents of a website you like.
Or you can use a site like Project Gutenberg to find books that are available online.
You could see what word clouds you can get from famous books, like a Shakespeare play or a novel
by Jane Austen.
